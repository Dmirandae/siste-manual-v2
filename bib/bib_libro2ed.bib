  title = {{When Being 'Most Likely' Is Not Enough: Examining the Performance
	of Three Uses of the Parametric Bootstrap in Phylogenetics}},
  journal = {Journal of Molecular Evolution},
  year = {2003},
  volume = {56},
  pages = {198--222},
  abstract = {{I show that three parametric-bootstrap (PB) applications that have
	been proposed for phylo- genetic analysis, can be misleading as currently
	im- plemented. First, I show that simulating a topology estimated
	from preliminary data in order to determine the sequence length that
	should allow the best tree obtained from more extensive data to be
	correct with a desired probability, delivers an accurate estimate
	of this length only in topological situations in which most preliminary
	trees are expected to be both correct and statistically significant,
	i.e. when no further analysis would be needed. Otherwise, one obtains
	strong un- derestimates of the length or similarly biased values
	for incorrect trees. Second, I show that PB-based topology tests
	that use as null hypothesis the most likely tree congruent with a
	pre-specified topological relationship alternative to the unconstrained
	most likely tree, and simulate this tree for P value estimation,
	produce ex- cessive type I error (from 50\% to 600\% and higher)
	when they are applied to null data generated by star- shaped or dichotomous
	four-taxon topologies. Simu- lating the most likely star topology
	for P value esti- mation results instead in correct type-I-error
	production even when the null data are generated by a dichotomous
	topology. This is a strong indication that the star topology is the
	correct default null hypothesis for phylogenies. Third, I show that
	PB-estimated confidence intervals (CIs) for the length of a tree
	branch are generally accurate, although in some situ- ations they
	can be strongly over- or under-estimated relative to the ''true''
	CI. Attempts to identify a biased CI through a further round of simulations
	were un- successful. Tracing the origin and propagation of pa- rameter
	estimate error through the CI estimation exercise, showed that the
	sparseness of site-patterns which are crucial to the estimation of
	pivotal param- eters, can allow homoplasy to bias these estimates
	and ultimately the PB-based CI estimation. Concluding, I stress that
	statistical techniques that simulate models estimated from limited
	data need to be carefully cali- brated, and I defend the point that
	pattern-sparseness assessment will be the next frontier in the statistical
	analysis of phylogenies, an effort that will require taking advantageof
	the merits of black-boxmaximum- likelihood approaches and of insights
	from intuitive, site-pattern-oriented approaches like parsimony.}},

	running hundreds of times faster than existing programs for neighbor-joining
	bootstrapping. For analysis of large matrices, parsimony jackknifing
	is hundreds of thousands of times faster than extensive branch-swapping,
	yet is better able to screen out poorly-supported groups.}},

  year = {2004},

  number = {1},
  abstract = {{An ideographic concept of character is indispensable to phylogenetic
	inference. Hennig proposed that characters be conceptualized as "transformation
	series", a proposal that is firmly grounded in evolutionary theory
	and consistent with the method of inferring transformation events
	as evidence of phylogenetic propinquity. Nevertheless, that concept
	is usually overlooked or rejected in favor of others based on similarity.
	Here we explicate Hennig's definition of character as an ideographic
	concept in the science of phylogenetic systematics. As transformation
	series, characters are historical individuals akin to species and
	clades. As such, the related concept of homology refers to a historical
	identity relation and is not equivalent to or synonymous with synapomorphy.
	The distinction between primary and secondary homology is dismissed
	on the grounds that it conflates the concept of homology with the
	discovery operations used to detect instances of that concept. Although
	concern for character dependence is generally valid, it is often
	misplaced, focusing on functional or developmental correlation (both
	of which are irrelevant in phylogenetic systematics but may be valid
	in other fields) instead of the historical/transformational independence
	relevant to phylogenetic inference. As an ideographic science concerned
	with concrete objects and events (i.e. individuals), intensionally
	and extensionally defined properties are inconsistent with the individuation
	of characters for phylogenetic analysis, the utility of properties
	being limited to communicating results and facilitating future rounds
	of testing.}},

	An important modification of standard Markov models involves making
	the likelihood conditional on characters being variable, because
	constant characters are absent in morphological data sets. Without
	this modification, branch lengths are often overestimated, resulting
	in potentially serious biases in tree topology selection. Several
	new avenues of research are opened by an explicitly model-based approach
	to phylogenetic analysis of discrete morphological data, including
	combined-data likelihood analyses (morphology + sequence data), likelihood
	ratio tests, and Bayesian analyses.},

	on the basis of the relative degree of corroboration of the character
	in the character analysis provides a rational basis for character
	weighting if character conflicts occur in the cladistic analysis.},

	presented cladistic methods by referring to a model of the evolutionary
	process, neither the value nor the success of the methods is limited
	by the value or success of that evolutionary model. Dichotomous cladograms
	can be preferred simply on the basis of their maximal information
	content, without reference to speciation mechanisms. Because only
	the interrelationships of diagnosable taxa (those with unique sets
	of apomorphic characters) can be investigated, questions about whether
	speciation can occur without branching, or whether species become
	extinct at branching points, are irrelevant to cladistic practice.
	The distinction between plesiomorphic and apomorphic character states
	depends not on the reconstruction of actual evolutionary history,
	but on the discrimination of more general from less general characters;
	groups based on plesiomorphy are defined by the absence of characters
	and are therefore artificial. Hence cladistic methods are not the
	methods of phylogenetics per se, but the methods of natural classification

  year = {2001},
  volume = {50},
  pages = {580-601},
  number = {4},
  abstract = {Despite the relevant role of models of nucleotide substitution in
	phylogenetics, choosing among different models remains a problem.
	Several statistical methods for selecting the model that best fits
	the data at hand have been proposed, but their absolute and relative
	performance has not yet been characterized. In this study, we compare
	under various conditions the performance of different hierarchical
	and dynamic likelihood ratio tests, and of Akaike and Bayesian information
	methods, for selecting best-fit models of nucleotide substitution.
	We specifically examine the role of the topology used to estimate
	the likelihood of the different models and the importance of the
	order in which hypotheses are tested. We do this by simulating DNA
	sequences under a known model of nucleotide substitution and recording
	how often this true model is recovered by the different methods.
	Our results suggest that model selection is reasonably accurate and
	indicate that some likelihood ratio test methods perform overall
	better than the Akaike or Bayesian information criteria. The tree
	used to estimate the likelihood scores does not influence model selection
	unless it is a randomly chosen tree. The order in which hypotheses
	are tested, and the complexity of the initial model in the sequence
	of tests, influence model selection in some cases. Model fitting
	in phylogenetics has been suggested for many years, yet many authors
	still arbitrarily choose their models, often using the default models
	implemented in standard computer programs for phylogenetic estimation.
	We show here that a best-fit model can be readily identified. Consequently,
	given the relevance of models, model fitting should be routine in
	any phylogenetic analysis that uses models of evolution.},

	by swapping with reweighted characters. This process increases the

	will start from a different group (island) of trees that are only
	slightly, if at all, less optimal. In contrast, conventional heuristic
	searching with constant equal weighting can become trapped on islands
	of suboptimal trees. We test the new strategy against a conventional
	strategy and a modified conventional strategy and show that, within
	a given time, the new strategy finds trees that are markedly more
	parsimonious. We also compare our new strategy with a recent, independently
	developed strategy known as the Parsimony Ratchet.},

  journal = {Systematic Biology},
  year = {1983},
  volume = {32},

  number = {3},
  abstract = {The consequences of introducing fossil species into a numerical taxonomic
	data set are examined, using the Caminalcules as an example. This
	group of “organisms” was generated artificially according to principles
	believed to resemble those operating in real organisms.Inclusion
	of fossils into the phenetic classification introduces some nonconvex
	taxa at higher phenetic levels, but unites phenetically homogeneous
	groups of mixed Recent and fossil composition. There is good correspondence
	of phenetics with phylogenetic sequences. The taxonomic relationships
	of the phenetic classification of Recent plus fossil forms can be
	explained by the amount of evolutionary change known to have occurred
	in given internodes. All but one of the mutually closest pairs in
	the phenogram are ancestor-descendant pairs. Gingerich's stratophenetic
	method yields a reasonably good estimated cladogram, but is misled
	by the occurrence of homoplasy in portions of the tree.Adding fossils
	improves estimates of the true cladogram based on the distance Wagner
	method but not estimates based on the Wagner parsimony algorithm.
	Estimated cladograms approach the true cladogram more closely than
	phenograms do, yet even the best estimate including the fossils has
	a strict consensus index no higher than 0.667.There are 10 characters
	that define genera. Their removal from the data base affects phenetic
	classifications slightly, cladistic classifications somewhat more.
	A cladistic classification of the Recent Caminalcules unnecessarily
	raises the ranks of some taxa. The less speciose and more symmetrical
	taxa emerge at lower taxonomic ranks than more speciose and asymmetrical
	taxa. Adding fossils to the Caminalcules requires a greater number
	of ranks for a cladistic than for a phenetic classification.},
