  Title                    = {{When Being 'Most Likely' Is Not Enough: Examining the Performance
 of Three Uses of the Parametric Bootstrap in Phylogenetics}},

  Abstract                 = {{I show that three parametric-bootstrap (PB) applications that have
 been proposed for phylo- genetic analysis, can be misleading as currently
 im- plemented. First, I show that simulating a topology estimated
 from preliminary data in order to determine the sequence length that
 should allow the best tree obtained from more extensive data to be
 correct with a desired probability, delivers an accurate estimate
 of this length only in topological situations in which most preliminary
 trees are expected to be both correct and statistically significant,
 i.e. when no further analysis would be needed. Otherwise, one obtains
 strong un- derestimates of the length or similarly biased values
 for incorrect trees. Second, I show that PB-based topology tests
 that use as null hypothesis the most likely tree congruent with a
 pre-specified topological relationship alternative to the unconstrained
 most likely tree, and simulate this tree for P value estimation,
 produce ex- cessive type I error (from 50\% to 600\% and higher)
 when they are applied to null data generated by star- shaped or dichotomous
 four-taxon topologies. Simu- lating the most likely star topology
 for P value esti- mation results instead in correct type-I-error
 production even when the null data are generated by a dichotomous
 topology. This is a strong indication that the star topology is the
 correct default null hypothesis for phylogenies. Third, I show that
 PB-estimated confidence intervals (CIs) for the length of a tree
 branch are generally accurate, although in some situ- ations they
 can be strongly over- or under-estimated relative to the ''true''
 CI. Attempts to identify a biased CI through a further round of simulations
 were un- successful. Tracing the origin and propagation of pa- rameter
 estimate error through the CI estimation exercise, showed that the
 sparseness of site-patterns which are crucial to the estimation of
 pivotal param- eters, can allow homoplasy to bias these estimates
 and ultimately the PB-based CI estimation. Concluding, I stress that
 statistical techniques that simulate models estimated from limited
 data need to be carefully cali- brated, and I defend the point that
 pattern-sparseness assessment will be the next frontier in the statistical
 analysis of phylogenies, an effort that will require taking advantageof
 the merits of black-boxmaximum- likelihood approaches and of insights
 from intuitive, site-pattern-oriented approaches like parsimony.}},

  Abstract                 = {A recent review of the homology concept in cladistics is critiqued in light of the historical literature. Homology as a notion relevant to the recognition of clades remains equivalent to synapomorphy. Some symplesiomorphies are “homologies” inasmuch as they represent synapomorphies of more inclusive taxa; others are complementary character states that do not imply any shared evolutionary history among the taxa that exhibit the state. Undirected character-state change (as characters optimized on an unrooted tree) is a necessary but not sufficient test of homology, because the addition of a root may alter parsimonious reconstructions. Primary and secondary homology are defended as realistic representations of discovery procedures in comparative biology, recognizable even in Direct Optimization. The epistemological relationship between homology as evidence and common ancestry as explanation is again emphasized. An alternative definition of homology is proposed.© The Willi Hennig Society 2012.},

  Abstract                 = {Parsimony can be related to explanatory power, either by noting that each additional requirement for a separate origin of a feature reduces the number of observed similarities that can be explained as inheritance from a common ancestor; or else by applying Popper’s formula for explanatory power together with the fact that parsimony yields maximum likelihood trees under No Common Mechanism (NCM). Despite deceptive claims made by some likelihoodists, most maximum likelihood methods cannot be justified in this way because they rely on unrealistic background assumptions. These facts have been disputed on the various grounds that ad hoc hypotheses of homoplasy are explanatory, that they are not explanatory, that character states are ontological individuals, that character data do not comprise evidence, that unrealistic theories can be used as background knowledge, that NCM is unrealistic, and that likelihoods cannot be used to evaluate explanatory power. None of these objections is even remotely well founded, and indeed most of them do not even seem to have been meant seriously, having instead been put forward merely to obstruct the development of phylogenetic methods.© The Willi Hennig Society 2008.},

Ambiguities can be uncovered by resampling, but existing neighbor-joining programs may give misleading bootstrap frequencies because they do not suppress zero-length branches and/or are sensitive to the order of terminals in the data. A new procedure, parsimony jackknifing, overcomes these problems while running hundreds of times faster than existing programs for neighbor-joining bootstrapping. For analysis of large matrices, parsimony jackknifing is hundreds of thousands of times faster than extensive branch-swapping, yet is better able to screen out poorly-supported groups.}},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Three different types of data sets, for which the uniquely most parsimonious tree can be known exactly but is hard to find with heuristic tree search methods, are studied. Tree searches are complicated more by the shape of the tree landscape (i.e. the distribution of homoplasy on different trees) than by the sheer abundance of homoplasy or character conflict. Data sets of Type 1 are those constructed by Radel et al. (2013). Data sets of Type 2 present a very rugged landscape, with narrow peaks and valleys, but relatively low amounts of homoplasy. For such a tree landscape, subjecting the trees to \{TBR\} and saving suboptimal trees produces much better results when the sequence of clipping for the tree branches is randomized instead of fixed. An unexpected finding for data sets of Types 1 and 2 is that starting a search from a random tree instead of a random addition sequence Wagner tree may increase the probability that the search finds the most parsimonious tree; a small artificial example where these probabilities can be calculated exactly is presented. Data sets of Type 3, the most difficult data sets studied here, comprise only congruent characters, and a single island with only one most parsimonious tree. Even if there is a single island, missing entries create a very flat landscape which is difficult to traverse with tree search algorithms because the number of equally parsimonious trees that need to be saved and swapped to effectively move around the plateaus is too large. Minor modifications of the parameters of tree drifting, ratchet, and sectorial searches allow travelling around these plateaus much more efficiently than saving and swapping large numbers of equally parsimonious trees with TBR. For these data sets, two new related criteria for selecting taxon addition sequences in Wagner trees (the “selected” and “informative” addition sequences) produce much better results than the standard random or closest addition sequences. These new methods for Wagner trees and for moving around plateaus can be useful when analyzing phylogenomic data sets formed by concatenation of genes with uneven taxon representation (“sparse” supermatrices), which are likely to present a tree landscape with extensive plateaus. },

Measuring the distortion of different transformations with a convex increasing function of the number of transformations, and choosing those reconstructions which minimize the distortion for all transformations, may provide a better optimality criterion than the linear functions implemented in currently used methods for optimization. If trees are optimized using such a measure, transformation costs are dynamically determined during reconstructions; this leads to selecting trees implying that the possible state transformations are as reliable as possible. The present method is not iterative (thus avoiding the concern of different final results for different starting points), and it has an explicit optimality criterion. It has a high computational cost; algorithms to lessen the computations required for optimizations and searches are described.}},

  Abstract                 = {The main features of the phylogeny program TNT are discussed. Windows versions have a menu interface, while Macintosh and Linux versions are command-driven. The program can analyze data sets with discrete (additive, non-additive, step-matrix) as well as continuous characters (evaluated with Farris optimization). Effective analysis of large data sets can be carried out in reasonable times, and a number of methods to help identifying wildcard taxa in the case of ambiguous data sets are implemented. A variety of methods for diagnosing trees and exploring character evolution is available in TNT, and publication-quality tree-diagrams can be saved as metafiles. Through the use of a number of native commands and a simple but powerful scripting language, TNT allows the user an enormous flexibility in phylogenetic analyses or simulations.© The Willi Hennig Society 2008.},

The method is now a practical alternative to the other methods; indeed, the method appears to possess advantages over the other methods in terms of ability to use complex models of evolution, ease of interpretation of the results, and computational efficiency. However, the method should be used cautiously. The results of a Bayesian analysis should be examined with respect to the sensitivity of the results to the priors used and the reliability of the Markov chain Monte Carlo approximation of the probabilities of trees.},

  Abstract                 = {<p>The evolutionary dissimilarity between communities (phylogenetic beta diversity PBD) has been increasingly explored by ecologists and biogeographers to assess the relative roles of ecological and evolutionary processes in structuring natural communities. Among PBD measures, the PhyloSor and UniFrac indices have been widely used to assess the level of turnover of lineages over geographical and environmental gradients. However, these indices can be considered as ‘broad-sense’ measures of phylogenetic turnover as they incorporate different aspects of differences in evolutionary history between communities that may be attributable to phylogenetic diversity gradients. In the present study, we extend an additive partitioning framework proposed for compositional beta diversity to PBD. Specifically, we decomposed the PhyloSor and UniFrac indices into two separate components accounting for ‘true’ phylogenetic turnover and phylogenetic diversity gradients, respectively. We illustrated the relevance of this framework using simple theoretical and archetypal examples, as well as an empirical study based on coral reef fish communities. Overall, our results suggest that using PhyloSor and UniFrac may greatly over-estimate the level of spatial turnover of lineages if the two compared communities show contrasting levels of phylogenetic diversity. We therefore recommend that future studies use the ‘true’ phylogenetic turnover component of these indices when the studied communities encompass a large phylogenetic diversity gradient.</p>},

  Abstract                 = {Cladistic analysis is the analysis of hierarchically branching diagrams
 (cladograms), which estimate, with more or less informativeness and
 efficiency, one or more cladistic parameters. Branch points (components)
 comprise part of the information of a cladogram (the component information);
 and branch tips (terminal taxa) comprise the other part (the term
 information). In an analysis of five cladograms published on allodapine
 bees, components were segregated into four categories: (1) replicates;
 (2) components non-combinable with replicates; (3) components combinable
 with replicates and with each other; (4) components individually
 combinable with replicates but not with each other. Components replicated
 in cladograms based on independent data sets have low, but specifiable,
 probabilities of occurrence. For the five cladograms of bees, the
 replicates were found to be non-random (P = 10−17%). Through cladistic
 synthesis, categories (1) and (3) were combined in a general cladogram—the
 best estimate of the only apparent cladistic parameter. In a comparison
 of the five cladograms of bees, phyletic procedures proved more efficient
 and more informative than phenetic procedures in estimating the cladistic
 parameter, as represented by the general cladogram. The number of
 characters on which each of the five cladograms is based seems either
 uncorrelated, or inversely correlated, with the cladogram's efficiency
 in estimating the cladistic parameter.},

Zool. 28:537–546.—Although Hennig presented cladistic methods by referring to a model of the evolutionary process, neither the value nor the success of the methods is limited by the value or success of that evolutionary model. Dichotomous cladograms can be preferred simply on the basis of their maximal information content, without reference to speciation mechanisms. Because only the interrelationships of diagnosable taxa (those with unique sets of apomorphic characters) can be investigated, questions about whether speciation can occur without branching, or whether species become extinct at branching points, are irrelevant to cladistic practice. The distinction between plesiomorphic and apomorphic character states depends not on the reconstruction of actual evolutionary history, but on the discrimination of more general from less general characters; groups based on plesiomorphy are defined by the absence of characters and are therefore artificial. Hence cladistic methods are not the methods of phylogenetics per se, but the methods of natural classification in general; phylogenetic conclusions are an extrapolation from hypotheses about natural order.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite the relevant role of models of nucleotide substitution in phylogenetics, choosing among different models remains a problem. Several statistical methods for selecting the model that best fits the data at hand have been proposed, but their absolute and relative performance has not yet been characterized. In this study, we compare under various conditions the performance of different hierarchical and dynamic likelihood ratio tests, and of Akaike and Bayesian information methods, for selecting best-fit models of nucleotide substitution. We specifically examine the role of the topology used to estimate the likelihood of the different models and the importance of the order in which hypotheses are tested. We do this by simulating DNA sequences under a known model of nucleotide substitution and recording how often this true model is recovered by the different methods. Our results suggest that model selection is reasonably accurate and indicate that some likelihood ratio test methods perform overall better than the Akaike or Bayesian information criteria. The tree used to estimate the likelihood scores does not influence model selection unless it is a randomly chosen tree. The order in which hypotheses are tested, and the complexity of the initial model in the sequence of tests, influence model selection in some cases. Model fitting in phylogenetics has been suggested for many years, yet many authors still arbitrarily choose their models, often using the default models implemented in standard computer programs for phylogenetic estimation. We show here that a best-fit model can be readily identified. Consequently, given the relevance of models, model fitting should be routine in any phylogenetic analysis that uses models of evolution.},

 optimal (parsimonious) trees for data sets with large numbers of
 taxa and characters. This new strategy uses an iterative searching
 process of branch swapping with equally weighted characters, followed
 by swapping with reweighted characters. This process increases the
 efficiency of the search because, after each round of swapping with
 reweighted characters, the subsequent swapping with equal weights
 will start from a different group (island) of trees that are only
 slightly, if at all, less optimal. In contrast, conventional heuristic
 searching with constant equal weighting can become trapped on islands
 of suboptimal trees. We test the new strategy against a conventional
 strategy and a modified conventional strategy and show that, within
 a given time, the new strategy finds trees that are markedly more
 parsimonious. We also compare our new strategy with a recent, independently
 developed strategy known as the Parsimony Ratchet.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent debates concerning conflicting hypotheses of higher-level phylogeny such as the sister-group relationships of tetrapods, turtles, birds and snakes, serve as examples in the analysis of the nature of morphological evidence as it is currently used in phylogeny reconstruction. We note a recent shift of emphasis towards ever-larger data matrices, which may come at the cost of detailed character analysis and argumentation. Because the assessment of morphological characters necessarily entails a conceptual element of abstraction, there is also a threat that preconceived notions of phylogeny influence character analysis. Because the test of congruence does not address character analysis in itself, we argue that character hypotheses, i.e. primary conjectures of homology, need to be testable, and potentially refutable, in their own right. We demonstrate the use of classical criteria of homology (topological relations and/or connectivity, in conjunction with the subsidiary criteria of special similarity and intermediate forms) in the test, and refutation, of morphological characters. Rejection of the classical criteria of homology in the test of morphological character hypotheses requires the formulation of alternative methods of test and potential falsification of morphological characters that have so far not been proposed. © 2002 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society,2002, 75, 59–82.},

  Abstract                 = {Biogeography is the discipline of biology that studies the present and past distribution patterns of biological diversity and their underlying environmental and historical causes. For most of its history, biogeography has been divided into proponents of vicariance explanations, who defend that distribution patterns can mainly be explained by geological, tectonic-isolating events; and dispersalists, who argue that current distribution patterns are largely the result of recent migration events. This paper provides an overview of the evolution of the discipline from methods focused on finding general patterns of distribution (cladistic biogeography), to those that integrate biogeographic processes (event-based biogeography), to modern probabilistic approaches (parametric biogeography). The latter allows incorporating into biogeographic inference estimates of the divergence time between lineages (usually based on DNA sequences) and external sources of evidence, such as information on past climate and geography, the organism fossil record, or its ecological tolerance. This has revolutionized the discipline, allowing it to escape the dispersal versus vicariance dilemma and to address a wider range of evolutionary questions, including the role of ecological and historical factors in the construction of biomes or the existence of contrasting patterns of range evolution in animals and plants.},

  Abstract                 = {The consequences of introducing fossil species into a numerical taxonomic data set are examined, using the Caminalcules as an example. This group of “organisms” was generated artificially according to principles believed to resemble those operating in real organisms.Inclusion of fossils into the phenetic classification introduces some nonconvex taxa at higher phenetic levels, but unites phenetically homogeneous groups of mixed Recent and fossil composition. There is good correspondence of phenetics with phylogenetic sequences. The taxonomic relationships of the phenetic classification of Recent plus fossil forms can be explained by the amount of evolutionary change known to have occurred in given internodes. All but one of the mutually closest pairs in the phenogram are ancestor-descendant pairs. Gingerich's stratophenetic method yields a reasonably good estimated cladogram, but is misled by the occurrence of homoplasy in portions of the tree.Adding fossils improves estimates of the true cladogram based on the distance Wagner method but not estimates based on the Wagner parsimony algorithm. Estimated cladograms approach the true cladogram more closely than phenograms do, yet even the best estimate including the fossils has a strict consensus index no higher than 0.667.There are 10 characters that define genera. Their removal from the data base affects phenetic classifications slightly, cladistic classifications somewhat more. A cladistic classification of the Recent Caminalcules unnecessarily raises the ranks of some taxa. The less speciose and more symmetrical taxa emerge at lower taxonomic ranks than more speciose and asymmetrical taxa. Adding fossils to the Caminalcules requires a greater number of ranks for a cladistic than for a phenetic classification.},

  Abstract                 = {Alignment quality may have as much impact on phylogenetic reconstruction as the phylogenetic methods used. Not only the alignment algorithm, but also the method used to deal with the most problematic alignment regions, may have a critical effect on the final tree. Although some authors remove such problematic regions, either manually or using automatic methods, in order to improve phylogenetic performance, others prefer to keep such regions to avoid losing any information. Our aim in the present work was to examine whether phylogenetic reconstruction improves after alignment cleaning or not. Using simulated protein alignments with gaps, we tested the relative performance in diverse phylogenetic analyses of the whole alignments versus the alignments with problematic regions removed with our previously developed Gblocks program. We also tested the performance of more or less stringent conditions in the selection of blocks. Alignments constructed with different alignment methods (ClustalW, Mafft, and Probcons) were used to estimate phylogenetic trees by maximum likelihood, neighbor joining, and parsimony. We show that, in most alignment conditions, and for alignments that are not too short, removal of blocks leads to better trees. That is, despite losing some information, there is an increase in the actual phylogenetic signal. Overall, the best trees are obtained by maximum-likelihood reconstruction of alignments cleaned by Gblocks. In general, a relaxed selection of blocks is better for short alignment, whereas a stringent selection is more adequate for longer ones. Finally, we show that cleaned alignments produce better topologies although, paradoxically, with lower bootstrap. This indicates that divergent and problematic alignment regions may lead, when present, to apparently better supported although, in fact, more biased topologies.},
